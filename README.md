## About
Spellchecker (alpha version)

It kind of works but:
1. At this moment the code is in early alpha: it needs optimizing, refactoring, cleaning up etc.
2. No dictionary included, so it is not possible to spellcheck anything
3. Some function are to be removed - now they exist just for debugging

### TODO
- [ ] Add at least small dictionary to the library
- [ ] Add documentation about how to use the library
- [ ] Test on Linux distribution
- [ ] ? Improve spelling suggestions
- [ ] ? Optimizations
